Hello lucky reader!

Perhaps you’ve come through my resume or another link of mine, or you’ve stumbled upon this project by complete accident. Either way, you’re reading this README now, & are probably wondering, to some extent, what is this?

Asteroid Weaver is a C++ project made with SDL2, made in ~4 days, with 2–5 hours of work done per day. It’s my first full C++ project after taking a C++ course, & I’m excited to do & learn more from this point!
